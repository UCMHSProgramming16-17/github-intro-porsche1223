Once upon a time, there was a 16 year old girl named Amanda. Amanda went slightly crazy and forgot everybody's birthdays except her own. 

Fortunately for her, her friends still love her because of her wonderful personality. 

Kevin Tong was born on June 5, 2000. He is an only child, but that doesn't bother him.
He has many friends in Union County Magnet High School as well as people from Scotch Plains.
